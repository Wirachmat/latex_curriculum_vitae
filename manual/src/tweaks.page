latex_curriculum_vitae has some tweaks where you can customize it to your needs. There are two sorts of tweaks, some of
them are Ruby based and the other some are LaTEX based.

h3. Ruby tweaks

* .latex_curriculum_vitae: Contains a personal_data.tex where your personal information is stored. Actually it is used by the Cover.
Also there is stored the CSV-File what contains the records of all finished applications.
* /home/sascha/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.1/lib/ruby/site_ruby/2.2.0/latex_curriculum_vitae: There are placed the Ruby-libraries. Instead of
  /home/sascha you have to place your username. Also the 2.2.1 has to be match your Rubyversion. So you have to check this first.
  Also you have to modify the email.rb for your needs.
* /home/sascha/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.1/share/latex_curriculum_vitae: There are placed the LaTEX source files.
IMPORTANT: If you change the LaTEX sources to your needs, you have to make a backup before making a gem update. After the installation
you can use it to restore your work.

h3. LaTEX tweaks

The LaTEX source directory contains that subdirectories:

h4. Appendix

* Bibliography (a BibTEX file for your publications)
* Certificates (for different certificates)
* Empoyers_Reference (for the references from the last employers)
* First_References (for your job-training or the german Ausbildung)
* Study (for study stuff)

h4. Cover (contains the Cover.tex). The Cover.tex use that includes:

* \input{$HOME/.latex_curriculum_vitae/personal_data.tex}
* \input{$HOME/.latex_curriculum_vitae/entity.tex} The entity.tex will be generated by running the program.

Also it includes my picture from the Picture directory.

* \begin{textblock}{3}(3.0,18.5)
